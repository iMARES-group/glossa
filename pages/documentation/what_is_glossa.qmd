**GLOSSA** is a simple, interactive R Shiny app designed to help you model species distributions without needing to code. Using **Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)**, GLOSSA predicts species habitats based on presence and environmental data, allowing you to visualize both current and future distributions.

## How GLOSSA works?

GLOSSAâ€™s workflow is designed to be intuitive, with four main steps:

### 1. Data upload

- **Species occurrence**: Upload your species data with either presence/absence or presence-only records. GLOSSA can work with multiple species in one session, generating pseudo-absences when needed.
- **Environmental data**: Upload environmental rasters (e.g., from sources like Bio-ORACLE) matched to the occurrence points by location and time.
- **Projections**: Include layers representing future time periods or climate scenarios to generate predictions for each.
- **Study area**: Upload a polygon to define your study region, or let GLOSSA use the extent of your environmental data.

### 2. Data processing

- **Coordinate cleaning**: GLOSSA automatically removes duplicate records, filters out invalid points, and applies spatial thinning if needed.
- **Layer processing**: Environmental rasters are cropped, masked, and can be standardized.
- **Generate pseudo-absences**: For presence-only data, GLOSSA creates randomly distributed pseudo-absences across the study area.

### 3. Model fitting and prediction

- **Fit BART model**: GLOSSA fits a BART model, generating predictions for suitable habitats and native ranges, and computes an optimal threshold for presence/absence classification.
- **Model output**: The output includes metrics like AUC, ROC curve, confusion matrix, functional response curves, and variable importance.
- **Projections**: Projections can be made to different areas, time periods, and climate scenarios.
  
### 4. Visualization and export

After the analysis, GLOSSA provides interactive maps and charts to explore model results, allowing you to export data and visuals for further use.


## Why use GLOSSA?

GLOSSA simplifies species distribution modeling by:

- Making modeling accessible with a no-code interface.
- Offering robust machine learning predictions with BART.
- Supporting independent multi-species and scenario-based analysis in a single run.
- Providing detailed visualizations and export options for further analysis or publication.
