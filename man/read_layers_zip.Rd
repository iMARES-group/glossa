\title{Load Covariate Layers from ZIP Files}
\usage{
read_layers_zip(
  file_path,
  extend = TRUE,
  first_layer = FALSE,
  show_modal = FALSE,
  is_fit = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to the ZIP file containing covariate layers.}

\item{extend}{If TRUE it will take the largest extent, if FALSE the smallest.}

\item{first_layer}{If TRUE it will return only the layers from the first timestamp.}

\item{show_modal}{Optional. Logical. Whether to show a modal notification for warnings. Default is FALSE.}

\item{is_fit}{Logical. Should be `TRUE` when the ZIP contains the covariate layers used for model fitting, and `FALSE` when the ZIP contains projection layers. This flag is only used internally to place the extracted files in separate subdirectories under `tempdir()`, preventing fit and projection layers from being mixed. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing raster layers for each covariate.
}
\description{
This function loads covariate layers from a ZIP file, verifies their spatial characteristics, and returns them as a list of raster layers.
